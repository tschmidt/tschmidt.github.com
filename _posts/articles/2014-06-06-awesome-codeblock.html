  <p>
    While creating the <a href='https://github.com/tschmidt/author'>Author gem</a>, I
    ended up creating a Liquid plugin that allowed me to create much nicer code blocks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I just recently extracted out the code into <a href='https://github.com/tschmidt/liquid-awesome-codeblock'>its own plugin on github</a>
    and wanted to give you a taste of what it can do. Set up is pretty simple if you are
    using Jekyll and I have instructions on how to do this in the README for the project.
    All of the examples below show the code used to get the code block to display. It's
    very meta.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is the vanilla version:
  </p>
  
  {% awesome_codeblock %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}
  
  <p>
    What if you wanted to add a title?
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock title:"This is a title" %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock title:"This is a title" ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    This is perfect for adding the file you are talking about!
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock title:"path/to/file.extension" %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock title:"path/to/file.extension" ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    You want some line numbers? Okay. You can do that too.
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock show_line_numbers:true %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock show_line_numbers:true ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    Want some code highlighting? Got that covered.
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock lang:ruby %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock lang:ruby ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    Here's one of my favorites. How about highlighting a specific line? Say, one where
    something changed and you really want to draw attention to it.
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock highlight:"3" ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}
  
  <p>
    Would produce...
  </p>
  
  {% awesome_codeblock highlight:'3' %}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'ZOMG, Hello!'
  end
end
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    Showing part of a file and you don't want to start on line 1? Your wish is my command.
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock start_at:25 ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}
  
  <p>
    Would produce...
  </p>
  
  {% awesome_codeblock start_at:25 %}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}

  <p>
    Just keep in mind that if you start at a different number, and you want to highlight
    lines, they will need to be relative to the starting number.
  </p>

  {% awesome_codeblock %}
{{ '{% awesome_codeblock start_at:25 highlight:"26,27,28" ' }}%}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
{{ '{% endawesome_codeblock ' }}%}
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}
  
  <p>
    Would produce...
  </p>
  
  {% awesome_codeblock start_at:25 highlight:"26,27,28" %}
class Thing < ParentThing
  def say_hello
    puts 'Hello!'
  end
end
  {% endawesome_codeblock %}
  
  <p>
    The styles I'm using are from the default styles in the <a href="https://github.com/tschmidt/liquid-awesome-codeblock/tree/master/assets/stylesheets">project on Github</a>. You can 
    copy them exactly or use them for inspiration and make your own.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now go! Have some fun making code blocks more awesome!
