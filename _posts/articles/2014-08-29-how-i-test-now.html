title: How I Test (For Now)
tags:
  ["articles", "testing", "development"]
blurb: I had the opportunity to interview with Thoughtbot a few weeks ago, and the question of how I test came up. I hadn't really thought about it until then and it is something I've been thinking about lately.

    When I first learned to write tests, I was very unsure of how, where, when and what to
    test. I, like many people just getting into testing, went overboard. I wanted to be a
    good little TDD soldier, and as a result, I tested all the things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That quickly led to frustration. I didn't have the vocabulary back then to explain
    why it was frustrating, but I knew there had to be a better way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I started reading a lot of articles and posts about testing. Watching videos of others
    testing. Reading through tests of projects that were well received by the community.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Slowly, I started adopting common patterns that I saw. The biggest one, and the one
    that I think every developer who is just getting into testing should know, is this:
    <strong>You do not need to test everything</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's right. I said it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I used to get tripped up by this all the time. I became almost obsessive trying to get
    to 100% code coverage. The reality is, it's just not necessary.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once I embraced this idea, I started to think about how I was testing. I used to start
    with Unit tests. Then, I would test just the controller. Then, I would move onto 
    integration tests. This - based on my very loose interpretation - is referred to as inside-out
    testing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMHO, this approach places me, the developer, as the primary
    audience of the product I'm working. In reality, I am not the primary audience. The
    consumer, client, customer, student, whatever is the primary audience. They don't
    care that the class Lollipop has a method called "how_many_licks?". They just want to
    know when they click this thing on the screen that it will do what it's supposed to.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This realization has led me to adopt more of an outside-in approach.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I now begin with a feature spec. This is a high-level test that describes what actions
    a user takes to accomplish some task. The test ensures that the expected result is
    achieved.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As soon as I get to a point where the feature spec is not giving me feedback that moves
    me forward in my code, I will drop down to a lower level test. In most cases, the 
    feature spec is adequate and I don't need to do that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another reason for doing a lower level test is if there is a particularly complicated
    method I am working on. I like having the assurance of a test, especially when I begin
    the refactoring phase.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The final thing that I will share is that I never test private or protected methods.
    For me, a test suite should be documentation about your public API. Methods that other
    developers are free to use should be shown in the test suite. Having tests for 
    private or protected methods will just lead to confusion when another developer tries
    to use those methods.

    This is a topic that I could talk about forever, unfortunately, a blog article isn't
    necessarily the best medium. I may expand on this topic with a video of how I test
    later, but for now, I believe I've shared my core opinions on testing.

    What about you? How do you test? What tips or techniques can you share?
