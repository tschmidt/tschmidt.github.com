  <p>
    I was perusing the Jekyll documentation when I came across the <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/' target='_blank'>section about data files</a>.
    As soon as I read through the docs, I realized I had the perfect place to use them. In
    fact, I had several candidates that could be converted to using data files.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I decided that I would move the content in my site footer - bookshelf, sites &amp;
    resource, and social outlets - to data files. In order to do this, I created a
    <code>_data/</code> folder in the root directory of my sites project.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, I created a <code>YAML</code> file for each of the sections. The files themselves
    are pretty basic. Here's the <code>resources.yml</code> file as an example.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight yaml linenos %}
- name: Font Squirrel
  title: Handpicked fonts for graphic designers
  url: http://www.fontsquirrel.com

- name: Google Web Fonts
  title: Hundreds of free, open-source fonts optimized for the web
  url: http://google.com/fonts

- name: normalize.css
  title: Make browsers render all elements more consistently
  url: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>
    Now, in my HTML files, I can reference this data using <code>site.data.data_file_name</code>.
    You would need to change <code>data_file_name</code> to the name of the file you created
    under the <code>_data/</code> folder. In my example, it would be <code>site.data.resources</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Looping through the collection is done just like any other <a href='https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers#for-loops' target='_blank'>collection with the Liquid
        Templating Language</a>.
  </p>
  
  {% highlight html linenos %}
<section class="well">
  <header>
    <h3>Sites &amp; Resources</h3>
  </header>
  <ul class='unstyled'>
    {% raw %}{% for resource in site.data.resources %}
      <li>
        <a href='{{ resource.url }}' target='_blank' title='{{ resource.title }}'>{{ resource.name }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
  </ul>
</section>{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    And that's really all there is to it. This is a great way to clean things up a bit and
    makes it incredibly easy to add entries anytime I want.
