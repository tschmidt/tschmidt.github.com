<p>Are you new to Git and have no clue what a git workflow might look like? Have you been using git for a while but are still not sure how to use it effectively in your daily development work? Worried the cool kids are making fun of you? For the <strong>low price of free</strong>, I'll share my Git workflow with you and help you on your way to git-jitsu.<span id="continue"></span></p>
  
  <p>
    When I first switched to git, I used it like I would have subversion. It's
    what I knew and it was pretty easy to continue working in that mindset. The
    problem with this is that it's kind of a slap in the face. I mean seriously,
    it'd be like getting an iPhone and treating it like it were a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5110">Nokia 5110
    (ah, snap covers)</a>. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sure, subversion was good and it worked well, but git offered a new way of
    doing things. Some might argue that it is <a href="http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/">a</a> <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/code/why-you-should-switch-from-subversion-to-git/">better</a> <a href="http://www.gitology.com/chapter/benefits-of-using-git">way</a> of doing it too.
    The following is where I am today with my git workflow. It's still a work
    in progress, but I find that it's really helping me become a better
    developer.
  </p>
  
  <h2>First, a Disclaimer</h2>
  
  <p>
    This article will not teach you about installing git, setting it up, creating
    an account <a href="http://github.com">somewhere awesome</a> or letting you in on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">meaning of life</a>.
    If you need help with any of the above, let me know in the comments and I
    will do my best to get you an answer. For the sake of this article, I will
    assume that you are using <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. Let's begin...
  </p>
  
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>
    The first thing that I do in any project that I'm working on is to create
    a master branch and a development branch. The first it pretty simple. All
    you need to do is initialize git inside the directory you want to manage.
  </p>
  
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>into the root folder of your project
<span class="go">cd /my/awesome/project</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> initiate git
<span class="go">git init</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> add everything that currently exists in the project
<span class="go">git add .</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> making the first commit
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> adding the remote repo
<span class="go">git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project_name.git</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> pushing <span class="nb">local </span>commits to the remote
<span class="go">git push -u origin master</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      I know, I know. I just threw a shit ton of code at you without even the
      slightest warning. Don't worry, I'm about to break it down.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing that we did was to <code>cd</code>
      into the project that we want to manage using git.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Then we initialize git with a call to
      <code>git init</code>. This will create the appropriate files and directories
      necessary for git to know what's happening to our project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you've initialized git in your project, you
      will need to add the files and folders of your project so you can track
      their changes. If this is a brand spankin' new project, then you hopefully won't
      have too many things to commit. In fact, you may not have anything to
      commit. If that is the case you need to have at least one thing to commit.
      If I find myself in this situation, I simply type <code>touch README</code>
      to create a README file and use that as my first commit. To find out what will be added
      when you run <code>git add .</code> you can first run <code>git status</code>.
      This will list out all of the files that are currently not under version
      control. Also note that the '.' in <code>git add .</code> is a wildcard
      character that means "everything".
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making your first commit. Now, the word "commit"
      may seem a little scary to those of you just getting started with git, but don't be.
      When you "commit" in git - rhyming was not intentional - you are actually
      just committing on your local machine. In order for your fellow developers
      to see these changes, you need to push them to the server. We'll get there
      in a second. First, a few notes about the command <code>git commit -m "initial commit"</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <code>-m</code> flag is just a shortcut for adding a message. In order
      to create a commit you must specify a message. If you were to just type
      <code>git commit</code>, your editor of choice would be opened and you would
      need to enter a commit message and then save and close the file. I find
      that using the shortcut is not only faster but prevents me from getting
      chatty in my commit messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Before we can actually push our commits to the
      remote branch, we need to tell our local branch where that is. To do this
      we type <code>git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project_name.git</code>.
      You will obviously need to change `username' to your github username and
      `project_name' to your projects name. In order for this to work, you would
      have already created this project on Github as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Now that we've told our local repo how to talk
      to our remote repo, we can push our commits. The first time you
      do this it's a good idea to add the <code>-u</code> option so that you
      do not have to reference which local branch you are pushing. If you didn't
      add this option, every time you wanted to push changes from your local
      master branch you would need to type <code>git push origin master</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Development Branch</h2>
    
    <p>
      After running all of the commands above, we have a single branch in our
      git repository called 'master'. You can see this by running
      <code>git branch</code>. The asterisk (*) next to the branch name is a 
      visual indicator of which branch you are currently on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In my workflow, the master branch should <strong>always</strong> represent
      a pristine state. That means that you should be able to deploy your project
      to a production ready environment from the master branch. Does that sound
      like an environment you should be in when you are developing a new feature?
      Hells-to-the-no it isn't (if you answered yes, slap yourself).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For this reason, I create a new branch. I'm very clever and as such I use
      the name "develop" for the new branch. I know, completely tongue-in-cheek...
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anyway, you could really name this whatever makes the most sense to you.
      It could be called "staging" or "development" or "thisshitaintready". Whatever.
      The important thing is that whatever name you choose, it should be clear that
      this new, as-yet-to-be-created branch is where development work will take
      place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To create this branch locally, we will first need to create it on the
      remote server.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git push origin master:refs/heads/develop</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      If you chose to go in a different direction with your name, I won't hold it
      against you. But you will need to update the above code to reflect your
      new branches name and not "develop" as I have chosen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Next, you will need to create a local version of that branch and set it
      to track the remote version.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git branch --track develop origin/develop</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      The first argument after <code>--track</code> is the name of the local
      branch while the second is the remote branch you want it to be associated
      with. You could have chosen a different name but why the hell would you want
      to confuse youreslf like that. Really, that's just dumb.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now that you've created this new branch, you can run <code>git branch</code>
      again and you will see both the master and develop branches. The current
      branch is still 'master' so you will need to checkout the 'develop' branch
      with <code>git checkout develop</code>. Can you guess what the command
      to checkout the 'master' branch again is? Hopefully you said
      <code>git checkout master</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you are like me, you like shortcuts. And git offers one when it comes
      to creating a new local branch and checking it out. To do what we just did
      you could've typed <code>git checkout -b develop --track origin/develop</code>.
      The <code>-b</code> option tells the <code>git checkout</code> command
      to create a new branch, while the <code>--track</code> option tells
      it what remote brach to associate the new local branch with.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There you have it. I know it seems like a lot of work, but really it's
      not that bad when you see it all together. I've combined the entire process
      for you to see it in one code snippet. For this example, we are assuming
      that I have already created a project in Github called "proposals".
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">mkdir proposals</span>
<span class="go">cd proposals</span>
<span class="go">touch README</span>
<span class="go">git init</span>
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;</span>
<span class="go">git remote add origin git@github.com/tschmidt/proposals.git</span>
<span class="go">git push -u origin master</span>

<span class="go">git push origin master:refs/heads/develop</span>
<span class="go">git checkout -b develop --track origin/develop</span></code></pre></div>
      
    <h2>The Development Cycles</h2>
    
    <p>
      Now that we have everything set up and ready to go, I can talk about my
      development cycles. This includes 3 different types of local branches:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Features</li>
      <li>Releases</li>
      <li>Hot-fixes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Before I discuss each of these in detail, here's how I structure my release
      number: <code>major.minor.hotfix</code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <strong>major</strong> and <strong>minor</strong> number relate to
      features that have been competed in development. How you choose to increase
      these is really up to you but I look at it this way: If you create a new
      widget for the side panel, I would consider that a minor release. If you
      completely revamp the UI for an application, then I would consider that
      a major release. Just use your own judgment as this is really something
      that depends on the project you are developing. The one thing that I will
      say is firmly defined is the <strong>hotfix</strong> number. This will
      increase each time you fix a bug in the project you are working on. Since
      I am the only developer, this is pretty straight forward for me. I'm the
      only one doing hotfixes. If, however, you work with a team then you will
      need to designate who should handle hotfixes and how they get pushed to
      production. Since that is a whole other blog post in itself, we are going
      to focus on my situation; the single developer syndrome.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Feature Branches</h3>
    
    <p>
      Feature branches should contain only one feature. That's why I call them
      "feature" branches and not "features" branches. Now, I know this my seem
      a bit strange at first, but I really do believe that developing a single
      idea or concept per feature branch allows you to really focus on what needs to be
      done. If you are developing several features at once and something breaks,
      it's much harder to figure out which feature the break will affect. By
      focusing on one feature and only one feature, there is no question.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now, let's say that I want to add a login module to this application I'm
      developing. I would first start by making sure that my development branch
      was up to date.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git checkout develop</span>
<span class="go">git pull</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      Once I know that I have the latest code I would run any tests that are
      part of the project. How you run tests will vary on your own
      situation. For me, it's typically through <a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a> and <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a>.
      Once I know all the tests are passing and my code is up-to-date, it's time
      to tackle this new feature.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The first step is to create a new branch based on the develop branch.
    </p>
    
    <aside>
      <p>
        Since this is a feature branch I prefix the name with "feature". This
        just helps me to keep the branches organized. I do the same thing
        for hotfix and release branches as well. Not only does this help describe
        the branch, but as you will see a little later on, it will help distinguish
        the branch in the git log messages.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git checkout -b feature-login-module develop</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      Here, we are using the <code>-b</code> option for the <code>checkout</code>
      command to create and checkout a new branch in one step. The difference here
      is that we are <strong>not</strong> associating it with a remote
      branch. This means that it only exists on our local machine. The last
      argument we pass in is the branch that we want this new branch to be
      based on, which in this instance is the "develop" branch.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      From here, all development that is required for
      the new "login module" will be done in this branch. After you complete
      a task for the feature, make sure to commit those changes to the feature
      branch.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> hack, hack, hack
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> hack, hack, hack
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Another commit message&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      How do you know when to add a new commit? I typically do this after I get
      a spec or scenario to pass. That means I write a single spec or scenario,
      then I write the code necessary to make it pass, and then I add and
      commit those changes to the branch.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You've done all your hacking at the feature and now it's beautiful and shiny
      and complete. You've also run all your tests and made sure they are still
      passing (right?). Now what? Now, it's time to merge it back into the develop
      branch.
    </p>
    
    <aside>  
      <p>
        I use the <code>--no-ff</code> option so that the merge creates a new commit
        object. Basically, this will show a "Merge branch 'feature-login-module' into develop"
        when you run <code>git log</code> along with all of the other commit messages
        from that branch. I like this because I can see exactly when features
        were merged into the develop branch. If you don't want to see these meesages
        in the log, just omit the <code>--no-ff</code> option.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git checkout develop</span>
<span class="go">git merge --no-ff feature-login-module</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      Once the merge has been completed, we no longer need the feature branch.
      Let's go ahead and remove it.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git branch -d feature-login-module</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      There you have it, my workflow for feature branches. Here is a
      consolidated snippet of all the commands.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> make sure develop branch is up-to-date
<span class="go">git checkout develop</span>
<span class="go">git pull</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> create feature branch based on the develop branch
<span class="go">git checkout -b feature-some-descriptive-name develop</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> <span class="nb">test</span>, hack, hack, hack
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Description of change&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> <span class="nb">test</span>, hack, hack, hack
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Description of change&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> merge the feature back into the develop branch and remove feature branch
<span class="go">git checkout develop</span>
<span class="go">git merge --no-ff feature-some-descriptive-name</span>
<span class="go">git branch -d feature-some-descriptive-name</span></code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      See, that wasn't too bad was it. The only other thing that I will mention
      is that after I merge a feature branch back into my develop branch, I make
      sure I merge develop back into any of the feature branches I am working
      on. This ensures that everything is up to date and I catch any collisions
      that might occur in the feature branch and not in the develop branch.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Release Branches</h3>
    
    <p>
      When I'm finally ready to release a new version of the code base I use
      a similar technique to the feature branch workflow. The difference here
      is that there is no actual development done in a release branch. As a
      naming convention I will call the branch "release-<em>major#</em>.<em>minor#</em>".
      So for example I may create something like "release-1.3". To find out which
      release is next I will just run <code>git tag</code>.
    </p>
    
    <aside>
      <p>
        As with feature branches, release branches are based on the "develop" branch.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go">git tag</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; 1.0</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; 1.0.1</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; 1.0.2</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; 1.1</span>
<span class="go">-&gt; 1.3</span>

<span class="go">git checkout -b release-1.3 develop</span></code></pre></div>
      
    <p>
      The only thing that I will update in a release branch is the VERSION
      file and the HISTORY file for the project. These are just regular text
      files that I place in the root of the project.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text"># Example VERSION file
Major = 1
Minor = 2
Hotfix = 0

# Example HISTORY file
January 1st, 2012
  - Feature one
  - Feature two
  - Feature three
  
January 18th, 2012
  - Feature one
  - Feature two</code></pre></div>
    
    <p>
      Once I've updated the HISTORY and VERSION files with the appropriate
      information I do a single commit with a commit message of "Bumped version X.X.X".
      The release is then merged into master, tagged, merged into develop and
      finally deleted.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> add and commit changes to the VERSION and HISTORY files
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Bumped version 1.3.0&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> merge into master
<span class="go">git checkout master</span>
<span class="go">git merge --no-ff release-1.3</span>

    <p>
      Hopefully, most of that will look familiar to you. The only thing that
      is new here is where we tag the release. Tags are really useful for
      capturing your project at a particular milestone. I highly recommend
      using them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That's pretty much it for release branches. They are pretty straight-forward
      and just as easily implemented.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Hotfix Branches</h3>
    
    <p>
      The final branch type that I work with is the branch that I am hopefully
      not having to create on a regular basis. No matter how we try, as developers
      we will always encounter bugs. When this happens, I turn to this workflow
      for quickly squashing and patching the bug.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Unlike feature and release branches, a hotfix branch will be based on
      the "master" branch. It's also critical that when you address the bug
      that you do not allow yourself to creep on the scope of what you are doing.
      Fix the bug and the bug only.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> create hotfix branch
<span class="go">git checkout -b hotfix-squash-bug-x master</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> hack, hack, hack
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>
      I will also update the VERSION and HISTORY files right before I'm ready
      to merge the hotfix branch back into master. I personally do this with
      hotfix branches because I want everything pertaining to the hotfix in one
      branch.
    </p>
    
    <aside>
      <p>
        One note I will make here is that if you have a current release branch
        that you are working on, merge the hotfix into the release branch instead
        of the "develop" branch. The release branch will eventually be merged 
        back into develop.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="gp">#</span> update VERSION and HISTORY files and commit changes
<span class="go">git add .</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &quot;[HOTFIX] Explanation of hotfix&quot;</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> merge the hotfix back into master
<span class="go">git checkout master</span>
<span class="go">git merge --no-ff hotfix-squash-bug-x</span>
<span class="go">git push origin master</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> tag the hotfix
<span class="go">git tag -a 1.3.1</span>
<span class="go">git push --tags</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> merge the hotfix into develop branch
<span class="go">git checkout develop</span>
<span class="go">git merge --no-ff hotfix-squash-bug-x</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> remove the hotfix branch
<span class="go">git branch -d hotfix-squash-bug-x</span></code></pre></div>

      And there you have it, my git workflow. I know that was a lot to take in
      so I've create <a href="https://gist.github.com/2295693">a TL;DR version</a> that you can use for reference once you
      are comfortable with everything. Feed back - as always - is welcome.
