  </header>
  <p>
    You've landed on my blog. Who am I? I'm a social geek who loves to write code and also write
    about code. I've been building Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications since 2007 and 
    absolutely love it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The topics that I write about are quite varied, though. You might find advice on tools to use,
    tutorials on how to use a particular library, fun things you can do with HTML and CSS, or
    maybe just some thoughts on different subjects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I love sharing the knowledge that I've gained over the years and I hope you find something
    useful here. I also encourage you to leave comments and start a conversation. I love
    hearing from my readers, so don't be shy.
