      <p>
        I am an enthusiastic Ruby and Rails developer who likes to dip his toes in the design pool
        every once-in-a-while. I am currently the Senior web developer for
        <a href="http://coleman.hccs.edu" target="_blank">HCC Coleman College</a> in Houston, TX.
      </p>

        Besides programming, I enjoy spending time with my partner, my friends, reading, pretending to be an artist
        and just really enjoying life. What you are looking at is a public outpouring of all that
        jumbles around in my head. I hope you find something that piques your interest or, even better,
        helps you in some way.
